## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845-common device tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).
Moved a few things to common that don't make sense to be separate, and separated a few things that don't make sense to be commonized.
For the time being, the strategy is to move device-specific hardware features out of LiveDisplay/Lineage-SDK and into DeviceSettings,
to both be more consistent with sm8150 & sm8250 common trees, and because I don't know c++ and HIDL/AIDL well enough yet.

Rebased on the official lineage-18.1 branch of the LineageOS device tree as of August 2021.

* Please note that the lineage.dependencies file is woefully out of date; roomservice will not find everything necessary to compile the ROM correctly.

* For required manifest modifications, please see https://github.com/Terminator-J/roomservices/ (for marginally less out-of-date dependency info).
